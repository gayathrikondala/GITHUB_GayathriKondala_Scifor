What is a RESTful API?

A RESTful API is a type of application programming interface(API) that allows two computer systems to securely exchange information over the internet.

RESTful APIs have several advantages, including:
Flexibility
•Data is not tied to resources or methods, so RESTful APIs can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats, and even change structurally.
Scalability
•RESTful APIs are more scalable than other APIs.
Interoperability
•RESTful APIs use common web technologies to expose data models and functionality in a standardized way, which can improve interoperability across platforms.
•Developers don't need to install additional software or libraries when creating a RESTful API.
